# Airline-Management-System-Microservices-Backend

AirlineBookingSystem – Microservices-Based Airline Management Platform
A production-oriented, scalable microservices architecture designed to power a comprehensive airline booking platform. Built with Node.js, this system handles flight management, authentication, booking lifecycle, and asynchronous notifications with enterprise-grade reliability and horizontal scalability.

🏗️ Project Overview
AirlineBookingSystem is engineered following modern backend architecture principles:

API Gateway Pattern: Centralized entry point for all client requests with intelligent routing
Microservices Architecture: Independently deployable services with clear boundaries of responsibility
Asynchronous Communication: Event-driven architecture using RabbitMQ for loose coupling
Horizontal Scaling: Stateless services enabling seamless scaling across multiple instances
Centralized Authentication: JWT-based authentication with role-based access control (RBAC)
Cloud-Ready: Designed for AWS Auto Scaling and containerization
This system is built to handle real-world airline booking traffic, supporting hundreds of concurrent users with sub-second response times and guaranteed message delivery for critical operations.

🔧 Core Services
1. API Gateway (Api_Gateway/)
The single entry point for all client requests. The API Gateway is responsible for:

Request Routing: Intelligently routes incoming requests to appropriate microservices based on URL paths and patterns
Rate Limiting: Protects backend services from overwhelming traffic using express-rate-limit
Request Logging: Comprehensive logging via Morgan to track all API interactions for debugging and monitoring
Proxy Middleware: Uses http-proxy-middleware to transparently forward requests to downstream services
Security: Implements CORS, request validation, and header sanitization
Centralized Error Handling: Standardized error response formatting across all services
Key Responsibility: Acts as a facade, abstracting the complexity of multiple microservices from clients.

2. AuthService (AuthService/)
Manages authentication, authorization, and user/role management:

JWT Authentication: Issues and validates JSON Web Tokens for stateless authentication
Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): Implements fine-grained permissions (Admin, User, Support roles)
User Management: CRUD operations for user accounts with secure password hashing
Role Management: Dynamic role definitions and permission assignment
Token Validation: Middleware for validating tokens on protected endpoints across the platform
Database: MySQL with Sequelize ORM for persistent user and role data
Key Responsibility: Central authority for authentication and authorization across the entire platform.

Models:

User: Email, password hash, role associations
Role: Admin, User, Support roles with specific permissions
3. FlightAndSearch Service (FlightAndSearch/)
The source of truth for flight, airline, airport, and route metadata:

Flight Management: Complete flight CRUD operations (create, read, update, delete)
Flight Search & Filtering: Advanced search by departure/arrival airports, dates, airlines, and pricing
Airport Management: Manages airport codes, names, and locations
City Management: Geographic hierarchy (City → Airport → Flights)
Airplane Management: Aircraft inventory and configuration
Real-Time Data: Maintains current flight availability and seat inventory
Database: MySQL with Sequelize for transactional consistency
Key Responsibility: Authoritative source for all flight and route information. All booking validations depend on data from this service.

Models:

City: Geographic location data
Airport: Airport codes and metadata
Airplane: Aircraft type and capacity
Flight: Flight schedules, routes, pricing, and availability
4. Booking Service (BookingService/)
Manages the complete flight booking lifecycle:

Booking Creation: Accepts booking requests with passenger and flight details
Flight Validation: Verifies flight existence and seat availability via FlightAndSearch Service
User Validation: Ensures passenger is authenticated via AuthService
Transactional Integrity: Atomic booking operations with rollback on failure
Event Publishing: Publishes booking events to RabbitMQ for asynchronous processing
Booking Status Management: Tracks booking states (Pending, Confirmed, Cancelled)
Database: MySQL with Sequelize, owns its own booking schema
Key Responsibility: Orchestrates the booking process, validates prerequisites, and triggers downstream events for notification services.

Models:

Booking: Passenger details, flight references, booking status, timestamps
Event Publishing:

Publishes booking.created events to RabbitMQ
Enables Reminder Service to consume events without direct coupling
5. Reminder Service (ReminderService/)
Handles asynchronous booking notifications and reminders:

Event Consumption: Consumes booking events from RabbitMQ
Cron Scheduling: Uses node-cron to schedule reminder jobs (24h before, 2h before flight)
Email Notifications: Sends flight reminders via Nodemailer (SMTP)
Asynchronous Processing: Non-blocking, event-driven architecture ensures no impact on booking performance
Retry Logic: Automatic retry mechanisms for failed email deliveries
Database: Optional MySQL for tracking sent reminders and preventing duplicates
Key Responsibility: Enhances user experience through timely notifications without adding latency to the booking process.

Features:

Scheduled reminders at T-24h and T-2h before flight departure
Configurable email templates
Automatic cleanup of processed events

🏛️ High-Level Architecture (HLD)
Synchronous Request Flow
Client (Web / Mobile)
    ↓
Load Balancer (AWS / Nginx)
    ↓
API Gateway
    ├→ Routes to AuthService
    ├→ Routes to FlightAndSearch Service
    ├→ Routes to Booking Service
    └→ Centralized logging & rate limiting
The API Gateway is the single point of entry. It:

Validates incoming requests
Routes to appropriate service based on URL path
Logs all requests for monitoring
Applies rate limiting to prevent abuse
Formats and standardizes responses
Asynchronous Event Flow
Booking Service
    ↓
Publishes booking.created event
    ↓
RabbitMQ (Message Queue)
    ↓
Reminder Service (consumes asynchronously)
    ↓
Schedules cron jobs
    ↓
Sends email notifications
Key Design Principles:

Loose Coupling: Services communicate via events, not direct API calls (Reminder Service doesn't know about Booking Service)
Scalability: RabbitMQ buffers events, allowing services to scale independently
Reliability: Failed messages are retried; no data loss even if services are temporarily down
Separation of Concerns: Each service owns its domain and database schema
📡 End-to-End Request Flow
User Booking Journey
Step 1: User Authentication
├─ Client sends login request to API Gateway
├─ Gateway routes to AuthService
├─ AuthService validates credentials and issues JWT token
└─ Client receives token for subsequent authenticated requests

Step 2: Flight Search
├─ Client sends search request with departure/arrival dates
├─ Gateway routes to FlightAndSearch Service
├─ Service queries flight database and applies filters
├─ Returns matching flights with pricing and availability
└─ Response includes flight IDs, timings, seat counts

Step 3: Booking Creation (Synchronous)
├─ Client sends booking request with JWT token, flight ID, passenger details
├─ Gateway routes to Booking Service
├─ Booking Service authenticates token via AuthService
├─ Booking Service validates flight availability via FlightAndSearch Service
├─ Creates booking record in its own database
└─ Returns booking confirmation with reference number

Step 4: Event Publishing (Asynchronous)
├─ Booking Service publishes booking.created event to RabbitMQ
├─ Event includes passenger email, flight details, booking reference
└─ Request to client returns immediately (no waiting for notifications)

Step 5: Reminder Service Processing
├─ Reminder Service consumes booking.created event from RabbitMQ
├─ Stores booking event details in its database
├─ Uses node-cron to schedule reminder jobs
├─ At T-24h: Sends first reminder email
├─ At T-2h: Sends final reminder email
└─ Automatically retries failed email deliveries
Synchronous vs Asynchronous Communication:

Aspect	Synchronous	Asynchronous
Used For	Authentication, flight validation	Notifications, reminders
Services	AuthService, FlightAndSearch	Reminder Service
Benefits	Immediate feedback, data consistency	Decoupled, resilient, scalable
Trade-offs	Tight coupling, performance impact	Eventual consistency
🗄️ Database Design
Each microservice follows the Database-per-Service pattern:

AuthService Database
users (id, email, password_hash, created_at, updated_at)
    └─ roles (id, name, description, created_at)
    └─ user_roles (user_id, role_id)
Transactional consistency for authentication
Encrypted password storage
Role and permission management
FlightAndSearch Database
cities (id, name, country, created_at)
    └─ airports (id, city_id, code, name, created_at)
        └─ airplanes (id, model, capacity, created_at)
            └─ flights (id, airplane_id, departure_airport_id, arrival_airport_id,
                        departure_time, arrival_time, price, available_seats, created_at)
Normalized schema for flight data integrity
Indexed on frequently searched fields (date, airports, price)
Real-time seat availability tracking
Booking Service Database
bookings (id, user_id, flight_id, passenger_name, passenger_email,
          status, booking_reference, created_at, updated_at)
Isolated from other services
Tracks booking lifecycle (Pending → Confirmed → Cancelled)
Maintains booking history for auditing
Reminder Service Database (Optional)
reminders (id, booking_id, email, flight_details, status, sent_at, created_at)
Tracks sent reminders to prevent duplicates
Stores scheduling metadata
Audit trail for notification delivery
Key Design Principles:
Data Ownership: Each service owns its schema exclusively
No Cross-Service Queries: Services communicate via APIs, not direct DB access
Consistency: MySQL ACID guarantees for critical operations (bookings)
Migrations: Sequelize CLI manages schema versioning and evolution
Seed Data: Initial data for airports, cities, airlines via seeders

Expected Performance Metrics
API Latency: < 100ms for flights search, < 50ms for bookings
Throughput: 1000+ requests/second per API Gateway instance
Availability: 99.9% uptime with multi-zone deployment
Scalability: Linear scaling up to 100+ instances
🛡️ Reliability & Observability
Rate Limiting & Protection
// API Gateway enforces rate limits
✓ 100 requests per minute per IP address
✓ Protects against DoS and brute force attacks
✓ Returns 429 Too Many Requests with retry-after headers
Comprehensive Logging
Morgan Logging Captures:
├─ Request: Method, Path, Query Parameters, Headers
├─ Response: Status Code, Response Time, Size
├─ Client: IP Address, User-Agent
└─ Service: Request ID for tracing across services
Asynchronous Resilience
RabbitMQ Message Delivery Guarantees:
✓ Persistent message storage (survives broker restarts)
✓ Acknowledgment (ACK) mechanism ensures processing
✓ Automatic retry on failure
✓ Dead-letter queues for unprocessable messages
✓ No message loss in normal operations
Service Isolation
Benefits of Microservices Architecture:
✓ One service failure doesn't cascade to others

Architectural Principles
Mono-Repository Structure:

All services in single repository for easier management
Each service is independently deployable
Shared dependencies listed in individual package.json files
Services can be split to separate repositories as project grows
Service Independence:

Each service has its own config, routes, models, controllers
No shared code between services (prevents tight coupling)
Each service runs on different ports
API Gateway routes traffic to appropriate service
🚀 Setup & Installation
Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:

Node.js (v18 or higher)
npm or yarn
MySQL (v8.0 or higher)
RabbitMQ (v3.12 or higher)
PM2 (for process management)

npx sequelize-cli db:migrate
cd ..
Step 6: Setup RabbitMQ
Ensure RabbitMQ is running (local or Docker):

# Using Docker
docker run -d --name rabbitmq -p 5672:5672 -p 15672:15672 rabbitmq:management

# Access Management UI at http://localhost:15672
# Default credentials: guest / guest
Step 7: Start Services with PM2
Start all services using PM2 in cluster mode:

# Start all services
pm2 start Api_Gateway/index.js --name "api-gateway" --instances 2
pm2 start AuthService/src/index.js --name "auth-service" --instances 2
pm2 start FlightAndSearch/src/index.js --name "flight-service" --instances 2
pm2 start BookingService/src/index.js --name "booking-service" --instances 2
pm2 start ReminderService/src/index.js --name "reminder-service" --instances 1

# Save PM2 process list
pm2 save

# Monitor processes
pm2 monit
Step 8: Verify Services
Test API Gateway health check:

curl http://localhost:3000/health
Production Deployment with AWS Auto Scaling
For cloud deployment:

Create EC2 Instance: Ubuntu 22.04 LTS with Node.js installed
Install Docker: Containerize each service for consistency
Push to ECR: Store Docker images in AWS Elastic Container Registry
Create Auto Scaling Groups: For each service with CloudWatch metrics
Configure Load Balancer: AWS Application Load Balancer for traffic distribution
Setup RDS: Managed MySQL database with automated backups
Setup ElastiCache: Redis for optional caching layer
Configure RabbitMQ: AWS-hosted or self-managed on EC2
Enable Monitoring: CloudWatch dashboards, alarms, and log aggregation
💡 Use Cases
1. Flight Search
Scenario: User searches for flights from New York to London on December 25

Request → API Gateway → FlightAndSearch Service
          ↓
        Query flights matching:
        - Departure: JFK
        - Arrival: LHR
        - Date: 2024-12-25
        ↓
        Response: List of available flights with pricing
Benefits: Real-time availability, filters by price/time, sorted results

2. Secure User Registration & Login
Scenario: New user signs up for the platform

Step 1: User provides email & password
        ↓
Step 2: API Gateway → AuthService
        ↓
Step 3: AuthService validates, hashes password, stores in DB
        ↓
Step 4: Returns JWT token
        ↓
Step 5: Client uses token for authenticated requests
Benefits: Secure authentication, stateless JWT, no server-side session storage

3. Flight Booking with Async Notifications
Scenario: User books a flight and receives reminder emails

Step 1: User clicks "Book Flight"
        ↓
Step 2: Booking Service validates flight availability
        ↓
Step 3: Creates booking record, publishes event to RabbitMQ
        ↓
Step 4: Returns booking confirmation immediately (< 50ms)
        ↓
Step 5: Reminder Service consumes event asynchronously
        ↓
Step 6: Schedules email reminders at T-24h and T-2h
        ↓
Step 7: User receives emails without blocking booking API
Benefits: Fast response times, guaranteed notification delivery, decoupled services

4. Role-Based Admin Access
Scenario: Only admins can manage flights and pricing

Admin performs action
        ↓
API Gateway checks JWT token
        ↓
Verifies token includes "ADMIN" role via AuthService
        ↓
If authorized: Grant access to flight management endpoints
If denied: Return 403 Forbidden
Benefits: Centralized authorization, multiple role types, audit trail

5. Scalable Backend Handling Real-World Traffic
Scenario: Flight booking surge during holiday season

Traffic spike detected (1000 req/sec)
        ↓
API Gateway instances scale from 2 → 8
        ↓
Booking Service scales from 2 → 12
        ↓
Flight Service scales from 2 → 10
        ↓
Load balanced across all instances
        ↓
System maintains < 100ms latency
        ↓
After peak: Auto Scaling reduces instances, saves costs
Benefits: Automatic scaling, no manual intervention, cost-optimized

📊 System Design Highlights
Loose Coupling via Event-Driven Architecture
Traditional Tightly-Coupled Approach ❌

Booking Service
    ↓
Direct HTTP call to Reminder Service
    ↓
Wait for response
    ↓
If fails: Booking fails
Event-Driven Architecture ✅

Booking Service
    ↓
Publish event to RabbitMQ
    ↓
Return immediately
    ↓
Reminder Service
    ↓
Consume event asynchronously
    ↓
If fails: Retry; booking still succeeds
Database Per Service Pattern
Each service owns its data:

AuthService → airline_auth_db
FlightAndSearch → airline_flight_db
BookingService → airline_booking_db
ReminderService → airline_reminder_db
Benefits:

Services scale independently
Database schema changes don't affect other services
Clear ownership and accountability
No direct database access between services
Stateless Services Enable Scaling
Request 1 → Instance 1 (scale up, down, any instance)
Request 2 → Instance 2 (no affinity required)
Request 3 → Instance 3 (load balancer can route freely)
No session state = unlimited horizontal scaling

📝 Development Workflow
Adding a New Feature
Identify Ownership: Which service owns this feature?
Create Endpoint: Add route in appropriate service
Implement Logic: Service layer + controller
Add Database: Migration if new data needed
Test Locally: Run service individually
Test Integration: Start all services, test flow
Deploy: PM2 restart or container deployment
Debugging Across Services
Use request IDs to trace flow:

curl -H "X-Request-ID: req-12345" http://localhost:3000/api/flights
    ↓
req-12345 logged in API Gateway
    ↓
req-12345 passed to FlightAndSearch
    ↓
req-12345 logged in service logs
    ↓
Trace complete request journey in logs
🔒 Security Considerations
JWT Validation: All authenticated endpoints verify token
